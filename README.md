# Computer Vision
In this project, I employed the powerful OpenCV library and Python to detect and track moving cars within a camera recording. The core algorithms at play are frame differencing and background subtraction, which enable precise identification of moving objects in real-time video streams.

In task one, a remarkable feature comes to life: a dynamic green box outlining each moving car. This visual representation provides a clear and intuitive way to observe the detected cars as they traverse the scene, showcasing the seamless integration of computer vision techniques.

Taking the project a step further into task two, I introduced a sophisticated car counting mechanism. Focused specifically on the flow from the city's downtown to its bustling center, this module accurately counts the number of cars making this journey. It offers valuable insights into traffic patterns, aiding urban planners and traffic analysts in making informed decisions for city development and management.
